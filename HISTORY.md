## Unreleased


### Added

* Better handling of TCP errors in `BlockingTcpTransport`


### Changed

* It is now explicitly possible to connect and disconnect a transport in the
  `DlmsClient` instead of it being done automatically in `.associate()` and
  `.release_association()`. Context manager `.session()` works the same.

* Client to server challenge of DlmsConnection is always created independent of auth
  method. But only used if needed.


### Deprecated


### Removed

* Removed conformance validation in DlmsConnection. It seems like meters don't always
  follow it so better to leave it up to the client.
